  Actual:
  - design db, create ddl scripts
  - create entities, repos

* 16:00 - 20:00

  Planned:

  - create docker image, modify compose file to create db service, backend service but definitely not working

  Planned:
  - create git repo
  - spring data jpa repository for complex queries

  - service can't be reached when starting with docker compose
  - complex queries
  - buy new pc
